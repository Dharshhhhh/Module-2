# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

##  Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

##  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

##  Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)

```
## Output

## Result
Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully
